What is MultiTasking :
------------------------
1) Executing different task simultaneously is Multitasking.
2) There are 2 types of MultiTasking :
                                       1) Process-based : Executing different task simultaneously, where each task is
                                                          separate independent process. Eg: Operating-System
                                       2) Thread-based : Executing different threads simultaneously, where each thread
                                                         is a part of same program. Eg : Program-level usage.

3) Wherever there is independent-jobs are there in our Program, we should identify and create separate thread.
4) When compared with other Programming languages, developing MultiThread Program in java is easy as Java provide rich API,
            Thread, Runnable, ThreadGroup ........
