Thread-Priorities:
--------------------
Priority-Range : 1-to-10
                            1) Minimum-Priority : 1
                            2) Normal-Priority : 5
                            3) Maximum-Priority : 10

    For Priorities Thread class define following constants:
                                                            1) Thread.MIN_PRIORITY ----> 1
                                                            2) Thread.NORM_PRIORITY ----> 5
                                                            3) Thread.MAX_PRIORITY -----> 10

1) Thread Scheduler will use priorities while allocating processor.
2) The thread which have highest_priority will get chance first.
3) If 2 threads have same priority, then we can't expect execution order. It depends on Thread Scheduler.


Default-Priority :
-------------------
1) **********  Default-Priority of Main-Thread is always 5.
2) ********** Default-Priority for all other threads, default-priority will be inherited from Parent-Thread to Child-Thread.
              Whatever priority parent-thread has same priority its child-threads also have.


Methods for Priority :
----------------------- 1) getPriority();
                        2) setPriority(int p); ----> p should be from 1-to-10

****) Note : Some OS platforms don't provide support to Thread-Priorities.
