Records in Java :
------------------
1) With the help of keyword "record", with the help of this we can create special type of class.

   It is used to carry data. It is a replacement of POJO's.

   Suppose if we create a POJO which consist of (Constructors,Getters/Setters/toString...),to carry objects.
   We have to write so much boilerplate code just to carry some data.

   But in "record" compiler will auto-generate (Canonical-Constructors, Getters, toString()...).

   Note : But in records we will not have Setter methods, as records are "Immutable".
   Note : Canonical-Constructors are those Constructors which are generated by compiler
   and initialized fields in the same order they are defined in the record.
   We can also have multiple Constructor.

   We can have both static and instance methods() inside records.

2) It was introduced in JDK-14,

3) records fields are final and records itself is final, that means no other class can extend records.
