Usage of FileWriter and FileReader is not recommended because :
1) With FileWriter we have to manually \n line separator. it is time-consuming
2) With FileReader we can read data character-by-character, which is time-consuming
3) To overcome above problems we have :
                                        1) BufferedWriter :
                                        --------------------
                                         Special method : We have bw1.newLine() method for line-separator.....

                                        2) BufferedReader :
                                        --------------------
                                        Special method : We have readLine() method  for reading whole line......

BufferedWriter :
-----------------
1) To write character-data into File.

FileWriter fw1 = new FileWriter("fileName");
BufferedWriter bw1 = new BufferedWriter(fw1);

Note : BufferedWriter can only be used with FileWriter object.
       Refer Test-1 java program...

BufferedReader :
----------------
1) To read character-data from File. It overcomes the problem of FileReader.
2) We can read data line-by-ine in addition to character-by-character.

FileReader fr1 = new FileReader("fileName");
BufferedReader br1 = new BufferedReader(fr1);

Note : BufferedReader can only be used with Reader object.
        Refer Test2 java program
