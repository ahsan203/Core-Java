FileWriter :
-------------
1) To write data to any file, we FileWriter class.

2) Constructors :
------------------
There are 4 Constructors, 2 for "Over-writing" and 2 for "Append":

1) FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String fileName);
2) FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(File f);

3) FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String fileName, boolean append);
4) FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String fileName, boolean append);

3) Methods :
-------------
             1) write(int ch); ---> To write a single character.
             2) write(char[] ch); ---> To write Array of characters.
             3) write(String s); ---> To write Strings to file.
             4) flush(); ---> To make sure total data has been flushed to our file.

******** Note : The above all four methods() are available in all 3 "Writer-classes"
                i.e. in "FileWriter", "BufferedWriter", "PrintWriter".

4) The main disadvantage with FileWriter is we have to write "\n" everytime when we want new line.
   We can solve this problem, by using "BufferedWriter" & "PrintWriter".
