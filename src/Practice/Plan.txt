Arrays

Single-dimensional and Multi-dimensional arrays
Common operations (sorting, searching)
Basic Syntax

Naming Conventions
Code Structure
Comments and Annotations
Hands-On Practice
Write simple programs for loops, conditions, and array manipulations.







Day 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
-----------------------------------------------
Core Topics
OOP Concepts

Classes and Objects
Constructors (default, parameterized)
Method Overloading and Overriding
this and super Keywords
Access Modifiers (public, private, protected, default)
Inheritance and Polymorphism

Types of Inheritance
Method Overriding
Dynamic Binding and Polymorphism
Type Casting and instanceof
Hands-On Practice
Implement classes with constructors and methods.
Write inheritance and polymorphism examples.









Day 3: Advanced OOP and Core APIs
----------------------------------
Core Topics
Abstract Classes and Interfaces

Abstract methods
Differences between Abstract Class and Interface
Default and Static Methods in Interfaces
Core Java APIs

String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer
Wrapper Classes
Auto-boxing and Unboxing
Object Class Methods

toString(), equals(), hashCode(), clone()
Hands-On Practice
Practice creating and using interfaces.
Manipulate strings and demonstrate polymorphism with interfaces.







Day 4: Exception Handling and Multithreading
---------------------------------------------
Core Topics
Exception Handling

Exception Hierarchy
Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions
try, catch, finally, throw, throws
Custom Exceptions
Multithreading

Thread Lifecycle
Creating Threads (Thread Class and Runnable Interface)
Synchronization
Inter-thread Communication (wait, notify, notifyAll)
Hands-On Practice
Write programs demonstrating exception handling.
Create multi-threaded applications with synchronization.








Day 5: Collections Framework
--------------------------------
Core Topics
Collection Hierarchy

List: ArrayList, LinkedList
Set: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
Map: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap
Key Concepts

Iterators
Comparable and Comparator Interfaces
Generics
Queue and Deque

PriorityQueue
ArrayDeque
Hands-On Practice
Perform CRUD operations using different collections.
Write programs to sort collections using Comparable and Comparator.










Day 6: Java I/O and New Features
---------------------------------
Core Topics
Java I/O

File Handling (File, FileReader, FileWriter)
Buffered Streams
Serialization and Deserialization
Java 8+ Features

Lambda Expressions
Functional Interfaces (Consumer, Supplier, Predicate, Function)
Streams API (filter, map, reduce)
Optional Class
LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime
Hands-On Practice
Write file handling programs.
Create and manipulate streams using Java 8 features.










Day 7: Revision and Mock Practice
----------------------------------
Core Topics
Miscellaneous Topics

Reflection API
JDBC Basics (if applicable to your learning goals)
Enum and Varargs
Annotations
Final Wrap-Up

Review Key Concepts and Notes
Solve Commonly Asked Interview Questions
Debug and Optimize Code
Hands-On Practice

Practice coding problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or GeeksforGeeks.
Create a mini-project or write a program combining multiple concepts
(e.g., using collections, multithreading, and file handling).

General Tips for All 7 Days
Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse to test your code.

Review Notes or documentation for any concepts you find unclear.

Focus on Problem-Solving to solidify understanding, especially for OOP, collections, and Java 8 features.

Track Progress daily to ensure all key topics are covered.

This plan ensures you thoroughly revise Core Java while balancing theoretical knowledge with practical implementation.
