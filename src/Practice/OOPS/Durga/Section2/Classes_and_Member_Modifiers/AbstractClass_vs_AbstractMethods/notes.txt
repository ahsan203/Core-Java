Abstract-class vs Abstract-methods:
---------------------------------------------

1) Child-classes is responsible to provide implementation to abstract-methods of abstract-class.
2) If suppose abstract-class has 2 abstract-methods then compulsory child-class must provide implementation to all abstract-methods.

When to use abstract-methods?
***) Methods() which child-classes should provide implementation compulsory, such methods we should declare as abstract methods inside abstract-class.
