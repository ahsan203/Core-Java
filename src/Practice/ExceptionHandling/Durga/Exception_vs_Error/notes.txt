            2) Exceptions can be Checked and Unchecked.
            3) Exception which are Unchecked will occur at Runtime, whereas Checked Exceptions occur at compile time.

Error : 1) Recovering from Error is not possible.
        2) Error can be caused by then environment, in which the program is running.
