***) Note:
------------
1) We can use try-block without catch-block, but we have to use finally-block.
2) Without writing either catch-block OR finally-block we cannot use try-block.
3) In try-catch-finally, order is very important.
4) Alone catch-block without try-block is not allowed.
5) Alone finally-block without try-block is not allowed.
6) As for one try-block we can take multiple catch-blocks,
            But
   for one try-block we can take only one finally-block.
7) Curly-braces is mandatory for try-catch-finally blocks, even for writing one-statement also Curly-Braces is mandatory.
