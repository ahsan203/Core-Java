Enum with Inheritance :
-------------------------

1) All "enums" are direct child-class of Java.lang.Enum
2) So enum cannot extend other enums
3) As enum is final, so we cannot create child classes for enum

Therefore, "extends" is banned for "ENUM".
                But
      An "ENUM" can implement Interfaces.
