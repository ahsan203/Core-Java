switch-Statement :
--------------------

1) In Java, you cannot directly use double, float, or long as the type of the expression in a switch statement.
   switch statements only accept expressions that can be evaluated to an int, byte, short, char, or
   their corresponding wrapper classes (Integer, Byte, Short, Character) along with "String".
   This restriction is due to the way switch statements are implemented in Java,
   where the value of the expression is used to determine which case to execute,
   and the types of double, float, and long are not compatible with this mechanism.

2) However, you can still use int, byte, short, or char expressions within a switch statement
   to achieve similar functionality with double, float, or long values by converting them to compatible types.
   For example, you could use type casting or rounding to convert double, float, or long values to int, byte, short, or char,
   and then use these converted values in a switch statement.
