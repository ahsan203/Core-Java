Comparator interface :
-------------------------
1) Comparator is @Functional Interface which contains only SAM i.e. compare() method.
   Therefore, we can use Lambda-Expression.

2) As we know Comparator-Interface is used for Customized Sorting of objects.

3) compare() method :
---------------------
                        public int compare(Object obj1, Object obj2);

             Returns -1 : If obj1 has to come before obj2.
             Returns +1 : If obj1 has to come after obj2.
             Returns 0 : If both obj1 & obj2 are equal.
