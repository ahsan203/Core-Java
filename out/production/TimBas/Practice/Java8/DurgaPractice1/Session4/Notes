Anonymous-Inner Class :
-----------------------
We use Anonymous-Inner Classes with Interfaces to implement Interface methods without name as shown in below example :

Runnable r = new Runnable
{
    public void run()
    {
        for(int i=0; i<10; i++)
        {
            sout(i);
        }
    }
}

So, here we are not creating an object for Runnable-Interface,
Instead we have created an Anonymous-Inner class which implements Runnable Interface.
