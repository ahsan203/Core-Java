Enum : (Enumeration)
--------------------
1) If we want to represent a group of named constants under one name is called "enum".
2) To define our own dataType like Month in below example we use enum concept.

Example :
            enum Month{
                    Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
            }

   1)  As in java we hava "byte" datatype which has range (-128 to 127).
       Therefore, total 256 values are allowed when using byte dataType.

   2)  But Month is our own dataType which allows 12 values.

   3) Unlike other programming languages, Java's enum can contain (normal-variables, constructors(),....) along with constants.



   Internal Implementation of Enum :
 --------------------------------------
 1) Every enum internally gets converted  into class in java.
 2) The enum constants are public-static-final.
 3) Every enum-constant represents as an object of that enum.
