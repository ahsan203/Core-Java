Runtime-Stack-Mechanism:
----------------------------

For every thread JVM will create runtime stack....
Each and every method() call made by thread, one entry will be stored in internal stack.
That one entry of method() call in stack is called as Stack-Frame OR Activation-record.
Once any particular method() got completed, then it's entry from Stack also gets deleted.
After completing all the methods() then Stack and thread will be destroyed by JVM.
