final vs finally vs finalize() :
------------------------------------

final:
            1) It is an access-modifier, applicable for classes, methods(), variables.
            2) If a class declared as final, then corresponding class cannot have child classes. (Inheritance not possible)
            3) If a variable declared as final, then value of final-variable cannot be modified, it acts as constants.
            4) If a method() declared as final, then child classes cannot override that final method().

finally :
            1) finally is block, associated with try/catch.
            2) Inside finally block we write resource de-allocation code OR clean-up code.
            3) finally-block executes always, irrespective of exception raised or not in program.


finalize() :
            1) finalize() is method associated with Garbage-Collector.
            2) As we know if any object doesn't have any reference-variable than that object is eligible for Garbage Collector.
            3) GC will call finalize() to perform clean-up activities, just before destroying an object.
