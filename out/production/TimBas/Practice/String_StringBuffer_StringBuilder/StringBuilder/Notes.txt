StringBuilder :
-----------------

******** Note : All methods() of StringBuffer() are "synchronized". ************
 So, only one thread will be allowed to use method at a time.
 It is a thread-safe.
 This will reduce performance. So for MultiThreaded environment we cannot use StringBuffer.
 So in 1.5-version StringBuilder came.

 So every method present in StringBuffer is present is StringBuilder but without "synchronized" keyword in methods().
