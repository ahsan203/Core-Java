String VS StringBuffer & StringBuilder :
--------------------------------------------

1) If the content is fixed and won't change frequently, we should use String-object.

2) If the content is not fixed and keep on changing, and also we want thread-safety we should use StringBuffer concept.

3) If the content is not fixed and keep on changing, and don't want thread-safety then we should use StringBuilder.


**** Extras-Note : String is also thread-safe internally.
