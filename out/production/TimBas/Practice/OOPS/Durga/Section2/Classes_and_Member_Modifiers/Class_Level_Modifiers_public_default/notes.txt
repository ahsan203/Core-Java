->*** Whenever we are creating any class in java we have to specify access modifier to class like below:

1) public class Test { } => public means we can access this class from anywhere i.e. outside OR inside of te package.

2) class Test { } => default means (no-modifier) and default classes can be only be accessed from within the package only.

3) abstract class Test{ } => abstract class objects cannot be created.

4) final class Test{ } => final class cannot have any child classes.

5) And if suppose we have inner-Classes then we can use private, protected & static modifiers.

6) But for top-level-classes modifiers applicable are public, default, final & abstract.
