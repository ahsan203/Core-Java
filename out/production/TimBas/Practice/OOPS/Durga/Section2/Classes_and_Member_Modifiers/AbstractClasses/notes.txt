****) Abstract-classes : Partial implemented class

1) We cannot create object's directly to abstract-classes. (Instantiation of abstract-class is not possible)
2) We cannot call any abstract-methods directly from abstract-classes.

1) If a class contains at least one abstract-method, then compulsory that class as abstract.
2) Abstract class can contain 0 abstract-methods with other methods with empty bodies. example Adapter-class...
It is highly recommended, to declare Adapter classes as abstract class.
