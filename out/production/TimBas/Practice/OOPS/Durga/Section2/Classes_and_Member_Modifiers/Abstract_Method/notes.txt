***) Abstract means partial-implementation...
***) Abstract in java is applicable only on classes and methods() but not on variables.


***) What is the need of Abstract-Methods.
--> Sometimes when we know only partial-implementation about a method, then we can declare a method as an abstract.
Syntax:
---------------
1) public abstract int getNoOfWheels();
2) public abstract String getTaste();

*****) And the implementation of the abstract methods will be given in their Child-Classes.

Note:
************** If a class contains at least one abstract-method then the class should declare as abstract-class. ******************
abstract class Test
{
        public abstract void m1();
}
