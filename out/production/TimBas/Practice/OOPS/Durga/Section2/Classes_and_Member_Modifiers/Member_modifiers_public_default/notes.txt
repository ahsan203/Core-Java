Member-modifiers:
------------------------
Variables and Methods are members of class, so what modifiers we should use....let see below.

(1) public members : "It means global-level"
If we declare method() or variable as "public" then we can access those members from anywhere
i.e. from inside/outside of class and packages.
But the corresponding class should be public.

(2) default members : "It means package-level"
We can access default members only from same package, outside package we cannot access the members.
If we are not taking access-modifier before methods() and variables, then those members are default-members.


(3) private members : "It means class-level"
We can access private members only with-in the same-class.
Outside class, we cannot access private members.

***) Note : Recommended modifier for variables is "private", to achieve "Data-Hiding".
            Recommended modifier for methods is "public", so it can be used by multiple-classes.
