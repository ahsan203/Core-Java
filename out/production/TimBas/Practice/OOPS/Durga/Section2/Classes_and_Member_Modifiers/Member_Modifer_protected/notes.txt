-> The most misunderstood modifier in java is protected.


1) If a variable OR method() declared as protected, then we can access from anywhere with-in the package,
                                        But
   From outside of package we can access protected members only in child-classes.

2)  protected = <default-modifier> + Kids

***Note:
------------
3) Parent-class protected members, if we want to access from outside-package, then compulsory we should use-
-child-Reference only, Parent-Reference(Runtime-Polymorphism) cannot be used to access protected-members from outside the class.
