->What is a package?
ans) A group of related classes and Interfaces group together into separate unit.

Examples of packages...
1)java.sql
2)java.util
3)java.lang
4)java.io

As we have Date class present in both packages(java.sql & java.util), with the help of packages we can differentiate Date
-class based on packages.

Every class in java is a part of some package.
And it is highly recommended to use packages while building an application in real time.
