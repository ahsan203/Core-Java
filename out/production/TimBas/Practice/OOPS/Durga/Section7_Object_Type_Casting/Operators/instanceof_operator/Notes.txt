instanceof operator :
------------------------
syntax :     r instanceof X
                                where r : object-reference
                                      X : Name of class/interface


***** Note : There should be relationship between r & X, like ParentChild. If not we will get compile-time-error. ******
***** Note : "null instanceof X" is always false. *********

1) Refer Example-1 for understanding the usage of instance-of operator.
