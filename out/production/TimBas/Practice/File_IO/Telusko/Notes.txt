For taking input from user in java we can use any 2 classes :
                                                               1) BufferedReader
                                                               2) Scanner


1) InputStreamReader ip = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
   BufferedReader br1 = new BufferedReader(ip);

                OR
    BufferedReader br1 = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

2) Refer Scanner java program.... to understand Scanner class


Note :
-------
1) Scanner class came after BufferedReader......
2) In Scanner we have methods() to accept all primitive types including String, namely (nextInt(), nextDouble(), nextLine().....);
3) In BufferedReader we have only one method i.e. readLine(), which accepts only String data.
                            But
    we can give primitive values also by using XXX.parseInt()..... like below.
     ===>   int age = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine);......


4) next() VS nextLine() :
-------------------------
1) next() :This method() takes tokens which comes before whiteSpace in the Buffer.
2) nextLine() : This method() takes all tokens from the Buffer.
3) Refer Next_VS_NextLine() java program...
