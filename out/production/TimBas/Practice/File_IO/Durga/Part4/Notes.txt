PrintWriter :
-------------
1) For writing Character-data to File, we have 3 classes :
                                                           a) FileWriter
                                                           b) BufferedWriter
                                                           c) PrintWriter
 Note :Among all 3, "PrintWriter" is the best choice

2) In PrintWriter we have 2 important methods which overcomes the problem of above 2 other classes.

            1) pw.print(); ---> We can write any type of Primitive data directly to the File, including Strings as well.
            2) pw.println(); ---> println() method helps to go for newLine.

3) PrintWriter can directly communicate with File,
                   OR
   PrintWriter can communicate via Writer object.


4) pw.write(100)  VS  pw.print(100) :
------------------------------------
                                        pw.write(100); ---> It will write d in file
                                        pw.print(100) ----> It will write 100 in file

5) The most enhanced reader class is "BufferedReader" class for Character-data.
                        and
   The most enhanced writer class is "PrintWriter" class for Character-data.
